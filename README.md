# Gwin Protocol

Gwin allows you to increase or decrease the volatility of your ETH.

# Solidity Smart Contract

Stake GWIN, wETH, or DAI on the Rinkeby testnet in order to earn GWIN tokens.

# Setting Smart Contract

Deploy the smart contract to your preferred test network.
If deployed locally, you will receive test tokens automatically to your first wallet.

# How to Set Up

```
brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network ganache
```

or substitute preferred network in the place of "ganache"

# Front End

Check out my "Gwin Front End" code in order to set up a useable front end. Change the contract addresses at "gwin-front-end/constants/contractInfo.json"
