# Gwin Protocol

With Gwin you can increase your upside and downside exposure or reduce the volatility of your ETH.

Trying to understand complex derivatives or options calls, puts, or spreads is really out of reach for most people. But with Gwin you can simply adjust a slider that represents the exposure you want, and you’ll get to see how it measures up against a typical ETH position. Once you’ve selected what risk profile looks best for your situation, you deposit your asset and you’re on!
